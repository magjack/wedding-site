                        There is a train station outside Chatelherault called Chatelherault station. You can come straight from Glasgow Central low level. 
                        There is about a 0.5 mile walk from the station to the venue where we are getting married over country paths.

                        It is a 22 minute and 16.5 mile drive from Glasgow Central to Chatelherault. At not peak times this will cost about
                        Â£20 pounds per taxi when I checked on the GlasGo Cab app.
