                        We recommend to stay either in Tortosa (Lled√≥'s
                        hometown) or L'Ampolla (if you want to stay by the
                        beach). The Welcome Pica-pica will be in L'Ampolla, and
                        there will be buses from both Tortosa and L'Ampolla to
                        Les Moles on the day of the wedding. In L'Ampolla, Les
                        Oliveres and Hotel Cap Roig are good options; however,
                        you will need car transportation (5 min drive) to the
                        Welcome Pica-pica. The Parador, in Tortosa, is located
                        in the spectacular Zuda Castle, overlooking the city
                        from high above. In Spain, booking.com is usually better
                        than airbnb.com.
